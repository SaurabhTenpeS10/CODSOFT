# CODSOFT

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning tasks completed as part of the CODSOFT internship program. Each task focuses on different aspects of data science and machine learning, showcasing the application of various techniques and algorithms.

## Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

In this task, I used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

## Task 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

For this task, I developed a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques were used to tackle this problem. The project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allowed me to build a model that can accurately estimate movie ratings given by users or critics.

## Task 3: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

In this task, the objective was to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. I trained a machine learning model to accurately classify the flowers into their respective species using the widely-used Iris dataset.

## Task 4: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction involves forecasting product sales, considering factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. I utilized machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret sales data, allowing businesses to make informed decisions regarding their advertising costs and optimize their marketing strategies.

## Task 5: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

For this critical task, I built a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Handling class imbalance issues, preprocessing, and normalization were essential steps in the project. I trained a classification algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine and evaluated the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Techniques like oversampling and undersampling were considered to improve the results.

The completion of these tasks has allowed me to deepen my understanding of machine learning techniques and their practical applications in solving real-world problems. Each project has been an exciting journey into the world of data science, and I am eager to continue exploring more projects in the future.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates on my journey in data science and machine learning!
